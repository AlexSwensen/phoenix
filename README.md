## About Phoenix

*The lightweight OS X window manager for hackers*

* Current version: **1.0**
* Requires: OS X 10.9 and up

#### Install

* Download [Phoenix-LATEST.app.tar.gz](https://raw.github.com/sdegutis/phoenix/master/Builds/Phoenix-LATEST.app.tar.gz), unzip, right-click app, choose "Open"

#### Usage

Create `~/.phoenix.js`. Then add stuff like this in it:

```javascript
api.bind('E', ['cmd'], function() {
  var win = Window.focusedWindow();
  var frame = win.frame();
  frame.x += 10;
  frame.height -= 10;
  win.setFrame(frame);
  return true;
});
```

For more ideas, see [the author's config](https://gist.github.com/sdegutis/7756583).

Note: Phoenix can only be scripted in JavaScript.

#### Todo

- Needs an app icon and status bar icon
- In-app upgrade
- Way better API (the current one is just a quick port of Zephyros)
- API docs (they're totally MIA)
- Long term: Get [Beowulf](https://github.com/sdegutis/beowulf) up to par, and fork Phoenix to use that instead of JavaScript.
