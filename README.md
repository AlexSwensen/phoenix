## About Phoenix

*Faster, stronger, better fork of Zephyros.*

* Current version: **1.0**
* Requires: OS X 10.9 and up

#### Install

* Download [Zephyros-LATEST.app.tar.gz](https://raw.github.com/sdegutis/zephyros/master/Builds/Zephyros-LATEST.app.tar.gz), unzip, right-click app, choose "Open"

#### Usage

Create `~/.phoenix.js`. Then add stuff like this in it:

```javascript
api.bind('E', ['cmd'], function() {
  var win = Window.focusedWindow();
  var frame = win.frame();
  frame.x += 10;
  frame.height -= 10;
  win.setFrame(frame);
  return true;
});
```

#### Current status

Perfectly usable. What's left:

- In-app upgrade
- API docs are totally MIA

#### Future plans

- Get [Beowulf](https://github.com/sdegutis/beowulf) up to par, and fork Phoenix to use that instead of JavaScript.
